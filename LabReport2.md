The methods that are called in the code are `public void handle(final HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException`, `public static void start(int port, URLHandler handler) throws IOException`, ` public String handleRequest(URI url)` and a `main` method.
The relevant arguments are `URI url`, `String[] args`,  `final HttpExchange exchange`, `int port, URLHandler handler`
The relevant fields don't necessarily change, but they work together to create a server.
