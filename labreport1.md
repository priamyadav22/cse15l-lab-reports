## *cd Command:*
cd No Arguments:
![Image](cd_noargument.png)
absolute path: /Users/priamyadav
We got the output of nothing really changing because `cd` without any arguments will bring the parth to the root, which we already started at.

cd Directory:
![Image](cd_directory.png)
absolute path: /Users/priamyadav
Now we can see that the path has gone to the directory of downloads on my computer because using the command `cd` along with the directory brought us there.

cd File:
![Image](cd_file.png)
absolute path: /Users/priamyadav/Downloads
We can see an error message being brought up because `cd` can only be used with directories, not files.

## *ls Command*
ls No Arguments:
![Image](ls_noargument.png)
absolute path: /Users/priamyadav
Looks like `ls` command lists the files when we start off at the root with no arguments

ls Directory:
![Image](ls_directory.png)
absolute path: /Users/priamyadav
Now using the `ls` command with the argument of the Downloads directory, we can see a list of all the files in the directory.

ls File:
![Image](ls_file.png)
absolute path: /Users/priamyadav
The `ls` command with the argument of the .json file just prints out the file name.

## *cat Command*
cat No Arguments:
![Image](cat_noargument.png)
absolutepath: /Users/priamyadav
It doesn't really give off an input, I have to `control C` my way out of the loop.

cat Directory:
![Image](cat_directory.png)
absolutepath: /Users/priamyadav
It seems to let us know that `Downloads` is a directory.

cat File:
![Image](cat_file.png)
absolutepath: /Users/priamyadav
It displays different objects in the `.json` file.
